* UK Jetpack Workshop (29-sep-2011), also Mozilla All-Hands (12-16 sep-2011)
* probably one hour: 20min lecture, 30min hands-on, 10min wrap
* limitations
** parallel tracks, so don't depend too much upon the other tracks
*** so less UI, less page-mod
* ideas to get across:
** modules help isolate code
   - for JS devs who aren't used to programming in the large, this is new
   - stable interface (and abstration boundaries) enable parallel
     development, information-hiding
     - so having separate teams work on interoperable modules might be a good
       demo
** modules can enforce security isolation
   - fun demo could be to have one team write evil module, second team writes
     good module, the two modules must correctly work together
** modules help reuse code
   - provide some pre-written modules to simplify certain tasks
   - provide two assignments. The first could be written monolithically but
     would be best written in pieces. The second re-uses one of those pieces.
